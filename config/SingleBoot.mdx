# Steps to Install MASQ OS

The installation process of MASQ OS involves several steps. Here's a more comprehensive guide to help you through each one of them.

To start, you'll need to create a bootable USB drive with the MASQ operating system. This step involves using a tool called Rufus, which is known for its reliability and user-friendly interface. Open Rufus, and you'll see fields where you can select the MASQ ISO file and your USB drive. Make sure to make the appropriate selections, and then click 'Next'.
1. The next step is to boot your computer using the USB drive that you just created. The key to access the boot menu varies depending on the manufacturer of your computer. For example, it's F12 for Dell machines and either F2 or ESC for HP computers. Once you've successfully accessed the boot menu, navigate through it until you find and select your USB drive.
2. After booting from the USB, the GRUB boot menu should appear. From this menu, you need to select the option 'Install MASQ'. This will trigger the installation process to commence.
3. Once the live MASQ OS has loaded, you'll need to locate the 'Install MASQ' icon on the desktop. Clicking on this icon will prompt you to enter the password 'masq'. Upon successful password entry, the OS install wizard will open. This wizard will guide you through the remaining steps of the installation process.
4. At this point, you just need to follow the instructions provided by the installer. It is designed to be easy to understand and user-friendly. You will be prompted to enter the necessary information at various points. Following these prompts carefully should make the process smooth and straightforward.
5. Finally, you will be prompted to choose the 'Erase Disk' option and click 'Next'. This action will delete all existing data on the hard disk and create partitions automatically. It's important to bear in mind that this action is irreversible and will completely wipe your drive clean. After this, you will be asked to input your chosen username and password. Once you've entered these, click 'Install' to finalize the installation process.
